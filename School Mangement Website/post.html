          <h3>More about Credential of Readiness</h3>
          <p>
            The Credential of Readiness (CORe) is a comprehensive online program
            offered by Harvard Business School (HBS) Online. It’s designed to
            equip you with a deep understanding of essential business concepts
            and problem-solving skills. This program is a primer on the
            fundamentals of business thinking, preparing you to participate
            fully in the business world. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CORe consists of three courses:
            Business Analytics, Economics for Managers, and Financial
            Accounting. Each course is designed to instill fluency in the
            language of business. This is the same program that HBS offers to
            incoming students to prepare for the MBA classroom. In the Business
            Analytics course, you’ll start with basic descriptive statistics and
            progress to regression analysis. You’ll implement analytical
            techniques in Excel and apply fundamental quantitative methods to
            real business problems. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This course will enable you to analyze and
            interpret data to inform business decisions. The Economics for
            Managers course will enable you to drive critical business
            decisions. You’ll explore how businesses approach pricing strategy,
            evaluate market demand, and differentiate their offerings. You’ll
            learn how to apply economic principles to real business situations.
            In the Financial Accounting course, you’ll discover what’s behind
            the numbers in financial statements. You’ll learn how to evaluate
            the financial health of a business and prepare and evaluate
            financial forecasts. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The CORe program is self-paced with regular
            deadlines, typically requiring 8-15 hours of commitment per week.
            It spans over 10-17 weeks. Upon completion of all three courses and
            passing a final exam, you will earn a Credential of Readiness from
            HBS Online. This program is beneficial for professionals, MBA
            applicants, recent graduates, and students. It adds value to your
            organization and takes your career to the next level with a deeper
            understanding of essential business concepts1. Whether you’re
            looking to advance your current career, considering graduate school,
            or exploring new career paths, CORe equips you with the necessary
            skills to confidently contribute to business decisions and
            decision-making.
